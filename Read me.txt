This project contains:

The distance measurement between the object and the sensor is monitored 
using ultrasonic sensor and raspberry pi. The code in python language. 
The code is present in "ultrasonic senor and raspberrypi.py" file

The distance measurement is also executed in proteus software using arduino.
The code is provided in "ultrasonic sensor with arduino in proteus.ino" file.

The gps data is sent via a gsm module which is also done in proteus using arduino.
The code is available in "gps and gsm using arduino in proteus.ino" file.

The circuit connection of the arduino and ultrasonic sensor is shown in the
"ultasonic with lcd.png" file.

The circuit connection of the arduino with gsm and gps is shown in the "gps gsm.png" 
file.
